We're building an awesome Next.js blog using Markdown.

I am also adding some formatting like this:
- hey
- bye
- okay

```
Finally, some code
```

A paragraph with *emphasis* and **strong importance**.

> A block quote with ~strikethrough~ and a URL: https://reactjs.org.

* Lists
* [ ] todo
* [x] done

A table:

| a | b |
| - | - |

Autolink literals: www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

Footnote: A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.

Strikethrough: ~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.

Another table:

| a | b  |  c |  d  |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |

Tasklist:

* [ ] to do
* [x] done
